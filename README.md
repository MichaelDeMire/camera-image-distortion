 - **Saving image/video**: For start, you must to "Select folder" of your image/video saves by pressing following button and after press "Take Photo" button to take a picture/"Start Recording" button to record a video.

 - **Interactive interface**: There's optional buttons "Open Folder" (to open your saves folder) and "RU" or "EN" button which changes language of interface (only RUssian and ENglish are available).
## Problems
This program is written mainly by AI (DeepSeek) so there's problems.
 - Recordings saves are divided by video and audio apart
 - There's some formulas combination problems which cause the error window. In this case you should press "Clear Formula" and enter the another (working) one.
 - Undone interface
### Fate of program
I'm not so good at coding, so I pass this program in your hands to fork it. The project will not be uptaded and it'll be archived.
